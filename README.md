# Particle Filter


### Example 1: KS EQUATION
In this .ipynb we run the Deterministic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation under the initial conditions specified in Kassam and Trefethen. 

### Example 2: 
In these two notebooks: We run deterministic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and deterministic KdV equations under small random initial condition pertubations of order $10^{-8}$, and observe initial condition sensitivities of magnitudes $10^{8}$ and $10^{1}$ respectively.  

### Example 3: 
In these two notebooks: We demonstrate how to run a particle filter with the stochastic KS and KdV equation under transport noise. We include subsampled data in both space and time. 

These notebooks indicate a qualitive difference between the ability of the particle filter to converge between the KdV equation and the KS equation. In the context of the twin experiment (data is generated by the forward model). 

This is interesting in light of the Low dimensional behaviour of the KS equation, and the fact that the PF filter typically fails due to dimensionality of the state space being a challenge. The results in this example indicating that the equations sensitivity to initial condition and stochastic pertubation makes the KS more challenging. 

### Example 3a:
In this notebook we demonstrate how to use the 'ParticleFilterAll' class to run a particle filter and output the full trajectories, including the timepoints in between assimilation times. 

### Example 4: 


### Example 5: 
These notebooks demonstrate temporal and spatial convergence using a pathwise stochastic travelling wave solution to the KdV equation under constant noise.

Example_5_KDV_Temporal_Convergence_dW_refined.ipybn, also compares the exponential time differencing approach CSETDRK44, with a stochastic integrating factor method SIFRK44. Showing in this case the SETD scheme can be run at much larger timestep, and have much lower error. 

### Example 6: 
These notebooks visualise the deterministic solution, for the KdV and KS equation.
